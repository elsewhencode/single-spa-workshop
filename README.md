# üëª Single SPA Workshop

Welcome! You are going to learn the essentials of the single-spa setup. How exciting!

## üñ•Ô∏è Setup

This is small monorepo with each step in its own folder. You can either follow
along from the `00 - start` folder or skip to the step we are on, if things are
not working or to cheat by looking ahead.

This should install the dependencies for each step:

```shell
npm install
```


## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èSteps

Each step includes another `README.md` with the instructions to get to the next step.

If you want to follow along on your own you can use these files to get to the end state

* [00 - start](./00%20-%20start) A basic vite app that we can use as a starting point.
From here we will install the framework and load a sample test app from our code
* [01 - single spa](./01%20-%20single%20spa) With the framework ready, we can now
start implementing our microfrontend application
* [02 - the application](./02%20-%20the%20application) We have the framework and an
application. We can extend the usefulness by passing additional information from one to the other
* [03 - passing information](./03%20-%20passing%20information) Let's get our app ready to be deployed
* [04 - bundling things up](./04%20-%20bundling%20things%20up) For extra credit we can display several apps at the same time
* [05 - extra credit](./05%20-%20extra%20credit) Completed app
